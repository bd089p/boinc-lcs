Howto setup BOINC LCS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BOINC LCS can fetch the current workunit state (and other host information) from BOINC clients within your network
(or over the Internet) and displays it as an html page in your browser.

Requirements:

- A webserver with PHP 5 (Apache, Microsoft IIS, lighttpd...)
- PHP simplexml (Try <?php phpinfo(); ?> to display your PHP configuration, possibilities and modules)
- At least one BOINC client

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation steps:

1. Change to the php subdirectory.

2. Edit the file config.php with a texteditor and setup your clients as needed.
   The following examples are valid (absolute path, relative path or url)

   (Local resources under Unix/Linux)
   /path/to/BOINC/client_state.xml
   ../../BOINC/client_state.xml

   (Local resources under Windows)
   C:\Windows\Program Files\BOINC\client_state.xml

   (External resources)
   http://192.168.0.1/boinc/client_state.xml

   (External resources with miniserv.pl)
   http://192.168.0.1:8080/

   You do not have to add /boinc/client_state.xml to your url because the miniserv.pl delivers this
   file by default.

3. Save the file

4. Upload or copy all files to your webroot directory (or subdirectory of your choice) e.g.
   /srv/www/htdocs/boinclcs (or /opt/lampp/htdocs/boinclcs if you are using XAMPP) where boinclcs is the name of
   your subdirectory.

5. You can skip this step if you already have a webserver installed on your client machine/s or you do not have
   more than one computer.

   !!! Important !!!
   Since version 3.0 final, BOINC LCS has its own small webserver (miniserv.pl) written in Perl.
   Please take a look at INSTALL-MINISERV for more information on howto setup and run this script.
   If you prefer to install this script you can simply skip step 5 and 6 ;)

   First of all you have to install a webserver on the desired client to receive data. This has to be a simple
   webserver only. You do not have to install PHP on your clients, because its only challenge is to transmit
   the client_state.xml file over the network. Here are some examples of widely used webserver software for
   your operating system.

   Linux -> Apache, lighttpd, Tux, and many more...
   (Ask your package manager! There are many alternatives out there. Almost every webserver should be able
   to serve a simple xml file)

   On Windows XP Professional the Microsoft webserver IIS can also be used to do this. If you don´t want to use
   it, because your personal attitude says "I dont like it leave me alone!", you may find alternatives!
   Apache, lighttpd and many more are also freely available for your Windows machine...

6. After installing a webserver on the client, you have to make the client_state.xml available over the network.
   At least all webservers allow you to setup an alias or virtual host that points to your BOINC directory.
   Please make sure you have spent enough time on security if you plan to make your clients available over
   the internet!

7. Now you should be able to open the BOINC LCS stats page in your browser.

   Try to open http://hostname/boinclcs/ where boinclcs is the name of your subdirectory. (See step 3)
